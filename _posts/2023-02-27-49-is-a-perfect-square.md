Happy Birthday to me!  I'll be entering my 50th year of going around the Sun.  Fun dinner at a new place in town.  Great cake from my wonderful wife.  

Taking a break from social media for a few days was a refreshing change. The unstructured and overwhelming nature of the random information can be quite taxing. In the past, news was presented in a more organized manner, with clear distinctions between news and opinions. However, social media has blurred these lines. Additionally, the emergence of celebrity journalists on cable news channels has further complicated matters, making it challenging to differentiate between fact and opinion. For me, a true professional journalist is one who relies on facts to craft their stories and avoids any attempt to influence the readers towards a particular viewpoint.  Instead now it seems to be a race to be first and get the most likes on your social media posts.  At times breaking the story without awareness of the consequences.

I've been thinking a lot about transistions lately.  Change is constant, but often we don't pay attention until it happens directly to us.  I don't fear change and usually look forward to new experiences, but I do fear the unknown.  A recent example is my daughter has begun to drive.  She did her 6 hours of training behind the wheel and is getting her permit.  I'm happy to see her gaining indepedence, but I do fear the danger of driving.  How will she handle the situations that we struggle with even as experienced drivers?  We often forget how much thought goes into driving and all the mechanics we had to learn to operate our vehicles.
